		<td>Users and operators should be able to study the bible without making compromises. That includes not having to compromise by using a platform other than their favorite.

		<td>Modules-basic</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>categorize modules into 1) bible texts, 2) commentaries, 3) lexicons/dictionaries, 4) Glossaries, 5) Daily devotionals, and 6) generic books).
		<br> 
		For bible texts, attempt to minimize workload by sharing data. For example, SWORD modules in KJV doesn't have to be a different KJV than project Gutenberg, if the files are shared. 
		</td>
	<!-- details ... 
		The missions special group can include a lot of subjects - health, buildings, transportation, etc.

		evangelism: Should the technology domain be involved in evangelism, such as optimizing the presentation / marketing of bible apps? Do the Android and Apple stores have the ability to reach those using other human languages? Are the Android/Apple stores unable to reach any locations?
		
	-->
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>3b</td>
		<td>Modules-library</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Describe the scope of modules and determine if they can be used for a library. A lot more categories are in use beyond the module basics. Often there are special books or studies for children (Awana, Good News Club), youth, men, women, seniors, widows & widowers, etc. Further, worship (music), evangelism (outreach), missions categories exist. Is it a good idea to capture studies in modules? 
		<br>
		Is it possible to preserve original scriptures from which other translations are derived?

	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>Module testing</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Support review of modules. The label of cult / unorthodox / questionable material is one example where this already occurred. But more assessments are possible and mentioned in some bible studies such as how a particular verse or section was translated. Consider a feedback mechanism.</td>
	<!-- details ...
	Module testing isn't software testing. It is to defend doctrine. Learning from history, 1 Tim 1:1-3 records how someone was able to introduce "strange doctrine", which Timothy needed to defend against. Likewise, Galatians 1:6-7 records how that church started to desert Christ.

	<tr>
		<td>5</td>
		<td>Scripture and software maintenance</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Scripture was previously on stone tablets (Ex 24:12, etc) and scrolls (Jer 36:2, etc). In the modern day, digital data and software programs are more common than stone and scrolls. Supporting the modern communications involves some dealing in data and software to reach people.
		<br>Maintenance and simplification of software can help minimize the chances of divided [software] kingdoms. If the burden is allowed to increase, the complexity/yoke could become too much for some, leading to a split (1 Kings 12).

		</td>
		<!-- details ...
		<br>
		Allow files to be converted to other formats unless there is a reason not to allow it.

		Are the buttons, menus, help, etc easy to use?

		Can non-computer people understand the most basic activities of maintenance without a lot of software training? For example, copying all the content to another backup, verifying the content is not corrupted.

		Is there a single process to handle enhancement/trouble reports or is this complicated by being split among different software sub-projects?

	Software size control was a goal copied from Caesar. Prevent uncontrolled growth in the amount of software that must be developed.
