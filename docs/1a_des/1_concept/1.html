<h3 id=a>Goals</h3>
<p>Table 1 attempts to capture some simple goals. The modules were assumed to be most significant. If all diligence was used to communicate with modules, it is possible the SWORD project documents currently on the crosswire site and wiki could just become one category in a module "library".

		<td><a href="https://crosswire.org/sword/modules/index.jsp">Existing</a></td>
		<td>Allow add-ins to expand functionality - 1) bible texts, 2) commentaries, 3) lexicons/dictionaries, 4) Glossaries, 5) Daily devotionals, and 6) generic books).
		<br> 
		</td>
	<!-- details ... 
		For bible texts that are not limited by a publisher like KJV, attempt to minimize workload by sharing data. For example, SWORD modules in KJV do not have to be a different that project Gutenberg, biblegateway etc, if a common set of files are in use. The library repository attempted to capture a version of KJV.
	-->
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>1b</td>
		<td>Modules - library</td>
		<td>Consideration</td>
		<td>There are 2 reasons for this. One is to be able to capture more categories for add ins. And second, not all churches be equipped run a library just like they may not be able to run a programming team. Additional categorories (pending publisher permission) include children's books (Awana, CEF), and studies for youth, men, women, prime timers, widows & widowers, etc. Also, there is worship (music), evangelism / missions categories. The SWORD project goals 2a/2b might fit as a mission since it is a means to distribute scripture.
		</td>
		<!--
		Other missions include health, buildings, transportation (planes), etc.

	<tr>
		<td>1c</td>
		<td>Module - bible text assessments</td>
		<td>Consideration</td>
		<td>Support review of modules. The label of cult / unorthodox / questionable material is one example where this already occurred in a rough manner. It is possible some bible studies identify confusing translations for one or more verses. Such identificaiton is its own area of expertise and can require people to know Hebrew, Greek, etc. Module testing is different than software testing.
	<br>1 Tim 1:1-3 records how someone was able to introduce "strange doctrine", which Timothy needed to defend against. Likewise, Galatians 1:6-7 records how that church started to desert Christ.

As cool as the SWORD project is, it was perceived to be one form of many forms of evangelism where evangelism could be a library category. For this reason, a second requirements document is being considered for the SWORD project as a missionary outreach.

Goals were divided into existing and consideration. Some existing ones were copied from the current crosswire internet site(s) or observed in existing front ends. Goals for consideration were added either due to not understanding the program, or as a check to ensure something wasn't inadvertently skipped.</p>

		<td>sponsor and provide a place for engineers and others to collaborate on free, open-source projects aimed at serving the Christian Church and offering research resources for seekers. Be a resource pool to other Bible societies and Christian organizations that can't afford -- or don't fel it's their place -- to maintain programming staff in house.</td>

		<td><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/about/">Existing</a></td>

		<td>2b</td>
		<td>distribute scripture to as many people within a domain as possible-paper</td>
		<td>Consideration</td>
		<td>Some people don't like or may not have an electronic devices. Paper printouts may suit this group. And certain people, after an hour or so of troubleshooting errors on their electronic device, become tired and don't want to keep operating the device. A paper bible allows theme to continue study without the interruption of finding a service technician to resolve the trouble.

		</td>
	</tr>


	<tr>
		<td>5b</td>
		<td>Software simplification / training</td>
		<td>Consideration</td>
		<td>Maintenance and simplification of software can help minimize the chances of divided [software] kingdoms. Some individuals may write independent programs because they either failed to build the existing SWORD project or couldn't comprehend it for whatever reason. Simplification and training are to prevent this from happening.

		</td>
		<!-- details ...
		<br>
		Allow files to be converted to other formats unless there is a reason ilike copyrights that do not to allow it.

		Are the buttons, menus, help, etc easy to use?

		Can a new developer run smaller classes on their own as a build up approach before running everything as a giant system?

		Assuming enhancement/trouble trouble reports are currently not integrated, can they be integrated for an increased level of overall cognizance?

	Software size control was a goal copied from Caesar. Prevent uncontrolled growth in the amount of software that must be developed.
