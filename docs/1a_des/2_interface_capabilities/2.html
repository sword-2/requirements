<p>Authoring Tools: The OSIS team is working to adapt free authoring tools that will hide most, if not all, of the markup from the casual user of OSIS. In the meantime, the best way to learn OSIS is to use a simple text editor, such as WordPad or Kedit on Windows, BBEdit on Alpha or MacOS, or vi in emacs on Linux. You can even use a word processor, though any formatting that you do in it won't matter (you would simply save the file as "text only").</p>
